# SQL satabases

In this repo you will find differente SQL databases. In each folder you will find:

- A self-contained file
- A project dump folder

Either the self-contained or the dump folder should work.

[Here's some docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-admin-export-import-management.html) on how to import.

On MySQL workbench, you can just:

`Server > Data import > Select the path to the file/folder`
